# Portfolio Guide (How I Document Labs)

## Naming
- Project folders: `projects/<topic-descriptive>/`
- Evidence: `captures/<device>_<command>_<yyyymmdd>.txt|png`

## Diagramming
- Use draw.io / diagrams.net. Export `diagram/diagram.png` at width ≈ 1600px.

## Screenshots
- Zoom 110–125% so text is readable.
- Crop to the relevant area; consistent width ~1200–1400px.

## Evidence
- Save CLI outputs as text files (not screenshots) whenever possible.
- Keep at least one successful ping/trace and 2–3 key `show` commands.

## README Style (per project)
- Problem → Design → Build Steps → Verification → Troubleshooting → What I Learned
- Always list the exact CCNA objectives.

## Status Badges (manual)
- ✅ Done, ⏳ In progress, 🧩 Planned
